# This playbook is to be run on a pre-install Alpine instance after running "alpine-pre-install.sh"
# Made for Alpine 3.18-r0 Standard, millage may vary
# It installs Alpine to the drive (setting ip and creating a user) and reboots

# WARNING: After the install the root user still has no password and can be logged into from ssh
# Continue with alpine-post-install.yml afterwards to fix this issue and install other components

# Besides requiring ansible to run this, you need community.general installed to use doas
# run this command on your local machine:
# ansible-galaxy collection install community.general

# your hosts file needs a category of alpine-preinstall, then you need to define these vars:
# keyboard_layout: "us us"
# new_ip: 192.168.1.222
# new_mask: 255.255.255.0
# new_gateway: 192.168.1.1
# new_hostname: alpine
# new_domain: your.name.scam
# new_dns: 8.8.8.8
# timezone: UTC
# new_user: user
# new_password_hash: password_hash # Generate via: ansible all -i localhost, -m debug -a "msg={{ 'password' | password_hash('sha512', 'mysalt')  }}"
# github_account: [your name]

# Now we have a fully installed Alpine Instance,
# that upon completing the reboot will show up on the new IP, with doas, the user and python ready to take further commands
# WARNING: root user is still present with an empty password and ssh login
# This will be addressed in alpine-post-install.yml

# You should remove the old host out of your known hosts via:
# ssh-keygen -f "~/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.1.X"
# Else installing future systems that take the same dhcp ip could get tricky
