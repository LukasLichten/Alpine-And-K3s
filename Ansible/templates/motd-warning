 
WARNING!

SSH Root Login is enabled, the root user is enabled and has an empty password!
This is a massive security risk

Either finish the install by running the third part, the ansible playbook alpine-post-install.yml
Or by fixing the problems manually:
- Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_conf and remove or edit the lines (at the end of the file):
    - PermitRootLogin yes
    - PermitEmptyPasswords yes
- Run 'doas passwd -l root' to stop root login

If you have just run alpine-pre-install.sh, then ignore this warning, and run the ansible playbook alpine-install.yml first
